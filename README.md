#  Pathfinder 🚀 - AI-Powered Career Roadmap Generator

  <!-- TODO: Replace this with a real screenshot of your app! -->

Pathfinder is an intelligent web application designed to help students and aspiring professionals navigate the complexities of choosing a career path. Instead of just matching keywords, Pathfinder uses Deep Learning to understand the user's skills and interests, recommends relevant job opportunities scraped live from across the web, and generates a personalized learning roadmap with high-quality courses and tutorials.

This project was built from scratch as a practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), web scraping, and modern web development practices.

## ✨ Features

-   **AI-Powered Semantic Search:** Utilizes `sentence-transformers` to understand the *meaning* behind a user's query, providing much more relevant job recommendations than simple keyword matching.
-   **Multi-Source Job Aggregation:** Scrapes and aggregates entry-level job postings from sources like LinkedIn, providing a rich and diverse dataset.
-   **Dynamic Learning Roadmap:** For the top job recommendation, Pathfinder performs a live search on YouTube and Coursera to find relevant, up-to-the-minute learning resources.
-   **Hybrid Recommendation System:** Combines live-scraped learning resources with a high-quality, pre-defined database of courses to ensure a robust and reliable user experience.
-   **Modern & Responsive UI:** Clean, professional, and mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

This project now includes a database for user accounts. The setup is slightly different and involves a one-time database initialization.

### First-Time Setup (Do this only once)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and navigate into it
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinder-project.git
cd pathfinder-project

# 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install all necessary packages from the requirements file
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Initialize the Database (CRITICAL - ONE TIME ONLY)
python init_db.py

#5
python -m scrapers.main_scraper
python generate_embeddings.py

# 6. Launch the Flask Web Application
python app.py
