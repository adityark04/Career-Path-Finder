#  Pathfinder üöÄ - AI-Powered Career Roadmap Generator

  <!-- TODO: Replace this with a real screenshot of your app! -->

Pathfinder is an intelligent web application designed to help students and aspiring professionals navigate the complexities of choosing a career path. Instead of just matching keywords, Pathfinder uses Deep Learning to understand the user's skills and interests, recommends relevant job opportunities scraped live from across the web, and generates a personalized learning roadmap with high-quality courses and tutorials.

This project was built from scratch as a practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), web scraping, and modern web development practices.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Semantic Search:** Utilizes `sentence-transformers` to understand the *meaning* behind a user's query, providing much more relevant job recommendations than simple keyword matching.
-   **Multi-Source Job Aggregation:** Scrapes and aggregates entry-level job postings from sources like LinkedIn, providing a rich and diverse dataset.
-   **Dynamic Learning Roadmap:** For the top job recommendation, Pathfinder performs a live search on YouTube and Coursera to find relevant, up-to-the-minute learning resources.
-   **Hybrid Recommendation System:** Combines live-scraped learning resources with a high-quality, pre-defined database of courses to ensure a robust and reliable user experience.
-   **Modern & Responsive UI:** Clean, professional, and mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.
